Included are the python scripts for the PyBank budget analysis and the PyPoll election results. Summaries of the data are included in text files in the respective analysis folders. This project involved importing CSV files, writing a python script to get the desired information, and writing the results to a text file. The files were loaded to github using commands in the terminal.
